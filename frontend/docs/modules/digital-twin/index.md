# Module 02: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to the Digital Twin module, where you'll learn how simulated environments replicate real-world physics, sensors, and interactions for safe testing and training of Physical AI systems before real-world deployment.

This module is designed for AI and robotics students with basic ROS 2 understanding, learners transitioning from software-only AI to simulation-based robotics, and developers interested in robot simulation and environment modeling.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll explore:

1. **Digital Twins in Robotics**: Understand the definition and purpose of Digital Twins and why simulation is critical for humanoid robots
2. **Physics Simulation with Gazebo**: Learn how to simulate gravity, collisions, friction, and build environments in Gazebo
3. **Sensors and Interaction in Simulation**: Explore how to simulate sensors like LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, taking you from fundamental Digital Twin concepts to practical simulation applications.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Familiarity with robotics concepts
- Interest in simulation and virtual environments

Let's begin exploring the world of Digital Twins!
