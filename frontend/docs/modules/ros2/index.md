# ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the ROS 2 module, where you'll learn how ROS 2 serves as the nervous system for humanoid robots. This module is designed for computer science and AI students, robotics beginners with Python knowledge, and learners transitioning from pure AI/software to Physical AI systems.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll explore:

1. **ROS 2 Architecture**: Understand how ROS 2 functions as the nervous system of robots
2. **Python Communication**: Learn to connect Python-based AI agents to ROS 2 controllers
3. **URDF Robot Descriptions**: Explore how robots are described and prepared for simulation

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, taking you from concepts through communication to embodiment.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Familiarity with software concepts
- Interest in robotics and AI integration

Let's begin our journey into the robotic nervous system!
