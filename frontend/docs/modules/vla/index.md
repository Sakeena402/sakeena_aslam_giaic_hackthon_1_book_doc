# Module 04: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module, where you'll explore how large language models (LLMs) and perception systems enable humanoid robots to understand natural language commands and translate them into executable robot actions within physical environments.

This module is designed for AI and robotics students with prior ROS 2 and perception knowledge, learners interested in LLM-powered robotics, and developers building cognitive agents for physical systems.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll explore:

1. **Vision-Language-Action Systems**: Understanding the VLA paradigm, the role of vision, language, and action modules, and why LLMs are suited for high-level reasoning
2. **Voice-to-Action Pipelines**: Learning about speech-to-text concepts, converting voice commands into structured intent, and task decomposition processes
3. **Cognitive Planning with LLMs and ROS 2**: Discovering how to use LLMs for goal-based planning and translating natural language into ROS 2 action sequences

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, taking you from fundamental VLA concepts to advanced cognitive planning applications.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts from previous modules
- Knowledge of perception systems from the Isaac module
- Familiarity with humanoid robotics concepts

## Learning Path

This module introduces the Vision-Language-Action paradigm that bridges natural language understanding with robotic action execution. You'll learn how LLMs serve as high-level planners rather than low-level controllers, enabling sophisticated cognitive behavior in humanoid robots.

Let's begin exploring the world of Vision-Language-Action systems!
