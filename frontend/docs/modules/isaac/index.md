# Module 03: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to the AI-Robot Brain module, where you'll explore NVIDIA Isaac as the AI brain of humanoid robots. This module will help you understand how advanced perception, navigation, and training pipelines enable robots to see, localize, and move intelligently in complex environments using hardware-accelerated robotics frameworks.

This module is designed for AI and robotics students with ROS 2 and simulation background, learners interested in perception-driven robotics, and developers transitioning from simulation to AI-powered autonomy.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll explore:

1. **NVIDIA Isaac and the AI-Robot Brain**: Understand what Isaac is, why it matters, the role of accelerated computing in robotics, and how Isaac Sim differs from Isaac ROS
2. **Perception and Localization with Isaac ROS**: Learn about visual perception in humanoid robots, Visual SLAM (VSLAM), sensor fusion, and hardware-accelerated perception pipelines
3. **Navigation and Intelligent Movement (Nav2)**: Discover what Nav2 is, path planning vs obstacle avoidance, and how perception connects to motion in autonomous systems

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, taking you from fundamental Isaac concepts to advanced perception and navigation applications.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Knowledge of simulation principles from previous modules
- Familiarity with humanoid robotics concepts

## Learning Path

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to NVIDIA Isaac as the AI brain for humanoid robots, connecting simulation concepts to real-world deployment through hardware-accelerated computing. By the end, you'll have a clear mental model of Isaac's role in the robotics pipeline and understand how perception connects to motion for autonomous behavior.

Let's begin exploring the world of NVIDIA Isaac!
