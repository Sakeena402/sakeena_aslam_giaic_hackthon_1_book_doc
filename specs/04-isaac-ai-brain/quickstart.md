# Quickstart Guide: Module 04 — The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

**Feature**: 04-isaac-ai-brain
**Created**: 2025-12-25
**Plan**: specs/04-isaac-ai-brain/plan.md

## Overview

This quickstart guide provides a high-level introduction to the NVIDIA Isaac module, designed for AI and robotics students with ROS 2 and simulation background. The module covers Isaac as the AI brain of humanoid robots, perception with Isaac ROS, and navigation with Nav2.

## Module Structure

The module consists of three chapters that build upon each other:

1. **Chapter 1**: NVIDIA Isaac and the AI-Robot Brain
   - Understanding Isaac as the AI brain
   - Isaac Sim vs Isaac ROS comparison
   - Role in the Physical AI stack

2. **Chapter 2**: Perception and Localization with Isaac ROS
   - Visual perception concepts
   - Visual SLAM (VSLAM) overview
   - Sensor fusion basics

3. **Chapter 3**: Navigation and Intelligent Movement (Nav2)
   - Nav2 navigation stack
   - Path planning vs obstacle avoidance
   - Perception-motion integration

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Knowledge of simulation principles from previous modules
- Familiarity with humanoid robotics concepts

## Learning Path

### Getting Started
1. Begin with the module index page to understand learning objectives
2. Proceed through chapters sequentially to build conceptual understanding
3. Pay attention to connections between Isaac components and their roles

### Key Concepts to Focus On
- The role of accelerated computing in robotics
- How Isaac bridges simulation to real-world deployment
- The relationship between perception and navigation
- How Isaac fits in the Physical AI stack

## Integration with Other Modules

This module builds on:
- **Module 02 (Digital Twin Simulation)**: Connects simulation concepts to real-world deployment
- **Module 01 (ROS 2)**: Expands on ROS concepts with Isaac ROS packages

This module prepares for:
- Future modules on VLA and LLM-based control
- Advanced autonomy concepts

## Navigation Tips

- Use the sidebar to navigate between chapters
- Each chapter builds on the previous one
- Look for collapsible sections for advanced concepts
- Diagrams are placed close to relevant explanations

## Success Metrics

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Explain the role of NVIDIA Isaac in Physical AI systems
- Understand the difference between Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS
- Conceptually describe Isaac ROS perception and VSLAM
- Understand Nav2 navigation concepts
- Describe how perception connects to motion and autonomy

## Technical Notes

- All content is conceptual and system-level focused
- No hardware-specific configuration steps included
- Focus on understanding rather than implementation
- Visual diagrams support conceptual understanding
- Technical terms are defined on first use
