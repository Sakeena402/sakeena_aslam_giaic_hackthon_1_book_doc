# Research Findings: ROS 2 Module Implementation

**Feature**: 01-ros2-nervous-system
**Date**: 2025-12-25

## Research Summary

This document consolidates research findings for implementing the ROS 2 module in the Docusaurus project, resolving the "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items from the technical context.

## Decisions Made

### 1. Docusaurus Structure Decision
- **Decision**: Create a new `modules/` directory under `frontend/docs/`
- **Rationale**: This follows Docusaurus best practices for organizing different content types while maintaining clear separation from tutorials or other content
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Integrate into existing tutorial structure (rejected - would mix different content types)
  - Create at root level of docs (rejected - less organized)

### 2. Sidebar Navigation Decision
- **Decision**: Create a new sidebar specifically for the modules section
- **Rationale**: This provides clear navigation separation while allowing for future module additions
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Extend existing sidebar (rejected - would make navigation cluttered)
  - Add as new category in existing sidebar (rejected - modules deserve their own section)

### 3. Collapsible Sections Decision
- **Decision**: Use HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` elements for collapsible sections
- **Rationale**: These are native HTML elements that provide good accessibility and don't require additional dependencies
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Docusaurus admonitions (not collapsible)
  - Custom React components (overkill for simple content hiding)

### 4. Diagram Format Decision
- **Decision**: Use Mermaid diagrams embedded directly in markdown
- **Rationale**: Docusaurus has built-in Mermaid support, making this the simplest solution for creating technical diagrams
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - SVG files (require external creation tools)
  - External diagram tools (add complexity to build process)

## Docusaurus Version and Configuration

The current Docusaurus setup uses:
- Docusaurus v3.x (based on configuration structure)
- Classic preset with docs, blog, and custom theme
- Autogenerated sidebar for current content
- Standard markdown rendering with Prism syntax highlighting
- Built-in Mermaid support available

## Implementation Approach

### Directory Structure
```
frontend/docs/modules/ros2/
├── index.md              # Module overview
├── chapter1.md          # ROS 2 as nervous system
├── chapter2.md          # Python agents and communication
├── chapter3.md          # URDF robot description
└── assets/              # Diagrams and images (if needed)
```

### Sidebar Configuration
The sidebar will be updated to include:
- A new manual sidebar for the ROS2 module
- Clear navigation hierarchy: Module → Chapter 1 → Chapter 2 → Chapter 3
- Proper labels and links to each section

### Content Implementation Notes
- Use H1 for chapter titles (followed by appropriate subheadings)
- Include code blocks with proper language annotations (python for Python code)
- Use Mermaid code blocks for diagrams
- Implement collapsible sections with HTML details/summary
- Use Docusaurus admonitions for important notes where appropriate
